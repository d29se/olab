    description:
      "Previously, I developed a novel protease substrate profiling method that is universally applicable to all proteolytic enzymes. This technique, termed Multiplex Substrate Profiling by Mass Spectrometry (MSP-MS), utilizes a highly diversified library of rationally designed synthetic peptides. When proteases are incubated with this peptide mixture, cleavage products are quantified by LC-MS/MS. In the past two years, I have collaborated with David Gonzalez and we have made improvements to this assay so that it has higher throughput, improved quantitation and sensitivity and allows us to generate kinetic values for hundreds of cleavage events in parallel. I was invited to present this work at the 10 th General Meeting of International Proteolysis Society in Canada. In January 2020, I receive $50k in pilot funding from the UCSD Mother Milk Infant Center to apply the MSP-MS technology to understanding the role of proteases in human milk. In addition, to substrate specificity profiling, I have developed a point- of-care protease assay with electrical engineer, Drew Hall (Jacobs School of Engineering) that uses electromagnetic sensors to detect peptide cleavage. This device will be miniaturized so that it can be powered by a mobile phone device and has applications for at-home quantitation of neutrophil elastase activity in sputum of cystic fibrosis patients or for rapid quantitation of matrix metalloproteinases activity in wound fluid during dressing changes. Dr Hall and I were initially funded by CTRI pilot funds and were subsequently funded by NIH/NIBIB with a Trailblazer Award to further develop this technology. I have presented this work at the 11 th General Meeting of International Proteolysis Society in Czech Republic and 2019 ASBMB Symposium of Serine Proteases, Potomac, MD.",

    heading: "Proteasome Inhibitors",
    description:
      "Previously, I developed several highly potent proteasome inhibitors that killed Plasmodiumfalciparum, the causative agent of malaria. These compounds showed little toxicity againsthuman cells or rodents. In the past two years, I have expanded my research program beyondmalaria and have validated that proteasome inhibitors were effective at killing a related parasite,Babesia divergens. In addition, I isolated and biochemically characterized proteasomes fromother eukaryotic human pathogens, such as the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni(collaboration with Conor Caffrey) and the protozoa Trichomonas vaginalis (collaboration withLars Eckmann, UCSD SOM) and have received NIH funding for both projects to develop potentand selective inhibitors. In addition, I received $165k from the EU to supervise and mentorpostdoctoral fellow Pavla Fajtova for two years in my lab. Her research is focused on developingproteasome inhibitors that are selective for T. vaginalis. Due to my expertise in proteasomeinhibitor research, I was invited to published a review article in FEBS and co-author a bookchapter for Burger&#39;s Medicinal Chemistry 8th Edition with Conor Caffrey. Outside of parasiteproteasomes, I have also performed extensive biochemical studies to uncover the functionaldifference between the human constitutive and immunoproteasomes. In collaboration, with BillGerwick, we have developed a set of highly potent and selective immunoproteasome inhibitorsand we have filed for a patent on this work. These inhibitors will be evaluated in animal modelsof auto-immune disease. ",

    description:
      "Proteases are known to play a central role in tumorigeneses and are often over-expressed and secreted in the tumor microenvironment. We determined that patients with malignant pancreatic cysts have high levels of the aspartyl protease, gastricsin and the serine protease, tripeptidyl  peptidase 1. In the past two years, we have developed an activity-based probe to stratify these patients and filed a patent. I have performed additional research in the cancer field to uncover the extracellular proteolytic profile of lung cancer cells lines and in urine of patients with bladder cancer. I received $15k in pilot award funding from the UCSD Academic Senate to pursue this research and generate data for an NIH or American Cancer Society grant proposal. For immune cells, I previously characterized proteolytic activity in neutrophil extracts and in a collaboration with Pieter Dorrestein, Nuno Bandeira and David Gonzalez have used this knowledge to determine that the proteases, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were responsible for excessive proteolysis in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis. Finally, Bill Gerwick and I have discovered cyclic peptides from marine bacteria that are potent inhibitors of neutrophil elastase and these may be developed further to treat cystic fibrosis.
